    Data in the 25 Gaussians example (upper-left)\@.
    The other GAN setups are shown in the other figures.
    The MH-GAN corrects areas of mis-assigned mass in the original GAN\@.
    DRS appears visually closer to the original GAN than the data, whereas the MH-GAN appears closer to the actual data.
    We show the state of the generators at epoch 30 (when MH-GAN begins showing large gains) on the left and epoch 150 (the final epoch) on the right.
