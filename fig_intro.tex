    On the left, we illustrate how training of $D$ and $G$ in GANs performs coordinate descent on the joint minimax objective, shown in the solid black arrow.
    If GAN training produces a perfect $D$ for an imperfect $G$, the MH-GAN wraps $G$ to produce a perfect generator $G'$, as shown in the final dashed arrow.
    On the right, we illustrate how the MH-GAN is essentially a selector from multiple draws of $G$.
    In the MH-GAN, the selector is built using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) acceptance rule from the discriminator scores $D$.
