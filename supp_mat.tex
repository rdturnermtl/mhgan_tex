In this section we present some of the samples from the various GAN setups in full page figures below.

We also note that the GAN approach to density estimation is complementary to the earlier \emph{density ratio estimation} approach~\citep{Sugiyama2012}\@.
In density ratio estimation, the generator $G$ is fixed, and the density is found by combining Bayes' rule and the learned classifier $D$.
In GANs, the key is learning $G$ well; while in density ratio estimation, the key is learning $D$ well.
The MH-GAN has flavors of both in that it uses both $G$ and $D$ to build $G'$.
